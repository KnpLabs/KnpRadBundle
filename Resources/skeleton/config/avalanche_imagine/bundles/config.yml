        # Configure a set of filters and then applying those filters to images inside a template. 
        # So, start by creating some sort of filter that you need to apply somewhere in your application. 
        # For example, suppose you want to thumbnail an image to a size of 120x90 pixels
        filters:
            my_thumb:
                type:    thumbnail
                options: { size: [120, 90], mode: outbound }
